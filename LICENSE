                      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

        0. Definitions.

           "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

           "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply
        to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
        
           "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed
        under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

           "Derived Works" means any work, whether in Source Object
        or other form, that is based upon the Program, or upon the
        Program, or upon the Program and any translation of the Program, and
        any modification, addition, deletion, or other modifications of the
        Program, or any portion thereof, to create new works
        incorporating, or otherwise merging the Program or portions thereof into
        other works.

           "Modification" means any addition to, deletion from, or change to
        the contents or structure of the Program.

           "Object form" means any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.

           "Source form" means the preferred form of the Program
        for making modifications to it, including but not limited to
        software source code, documentation source, and configuration
        files.

           "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
        standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
        interfaces specified for a particular programming language,
        one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

           The "System Libraries" of an executable work include
        anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included
        in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is
        not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use
        of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a
        Standard Interface for which an implementation is required to be
        passed to the Major Component, or to execute a standardized
        interface between the Major Component and other parts of the work.

        The "Corresponding Source" for a System Library means either
        the source code that is distributed with the System Library,
        or a path that is available at no charge to all recipients
        of the same Major Component and to anyone who receives the
        System Library, under the same license conditions that apply
        to the System Library as a whole.

        An "Independent Module" is a module which is not ruled by
        this License, and also a module which is not a System Library.

        A "Major Component" means a System Library that is used
        in creating the executable work, and that the
        Corresponding Source for the System Library is
        available to the user, under the same license conditions that apply
        to the System Library as a whole.  A Major Component is the
        essential part of the System Library.

        A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product",
        which means any tangible personal property which is normally
        used for personal, family, or household purposes,
        or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
        into a "consumer product".

        1. Grant of Copyright License.

           The Program is licensed, free of charge, to all users
        receiving a copy of this license, to use, modify, and
        redistribute the Program and any derivative works, without restriction
        subject to the following conditions:

           a) You must give any other recipients of the Program a copy
        of this license along with the Program.

           b) You must cause all modified files to carry
        prominent notices stating that You changed the files.

           c) You must retain, in the Source form of any
        Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright,
        trademark, patent, attribution and other notices from the Source form
        of the Program, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
        any part of the Derivative Works; and

           d) If the Program includes interactive functionality,
           each display of such functionality must display the
        appropriate copyright notice.

           e) If the Program includes an "instantiating" feature,
           such functionality must display the appropriate
        copyright notice.

        f) You may not remove or alter any copyright notices that
        appear in the Program.

           A "Standard Interface" includes a body of related
        standards that are well-defined and widely used, and
        which specify the requirements for compliant implementations.

        When the Program specifies that a "Standard Interface"
        applies to the Program, that interface is required to be
        implemented.

           When the Program specifies that a "Standard Interface"
        does not apply to a System Library, that library is required
        not to be used.

        The Program also specifies other terms that modify how a
        System Library may be treated under this License.  For example,
        if the Program specifies that a System Library may be
        "silently" included, that is fine.

        2. Grant of Patent License.

           Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
        contributor hereby grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
        royalty-free license under his or her patent claims that
        are infringed by the Program, to make, use, sell,
        offer for sale, have made, modify, import, and otherwise
        transfer the Program, where you do not convey any patent
        rights that are exclusively licensed to the contributor,
        and where the Program contains the entirety of the
        contributor's patent claims.  You may make, run, have
        made, and propagate covered works, but if you convey a
        derivative work, it must contain the same patent license
        notice.

           When you convey a covered work, you may also
        convey, on behalf of any of the contributors, patent
        licenses that you receive from such contributor, which
        must be in writing, that the contributor has granted
        you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license
        under the contributor's patent claims that are infringed by
        the contributor's contribution.

        If a patent license notice is provided with the
        Program, you may not remove or alter it.

        3. No Warranty.

           EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THE FOLLOWING
        PARAGRAPHS, THE PROGRAM AND ANY DERIVATIVE WORKS ARE
        PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
        EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE
        WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
        AND NONINFRINGEMENT.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR
        COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR
        OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
        TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
        WITH THE PROGRAM OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
        PROGRAM.

        4. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

           If you modify the Program, your modified files
        must be accompanied by a prominent notice stating that
        you changed the files and the date of any change.

           You may convey, and cause others to convey, modified
        versions of the Program subject to the following conditions:

           a) Your modified files must carry prominent notices stating
        that you changed the files and the date of any change.

           b) You may convey, and cause others to convey, modified
        versions of the Program, provided that you also meet all of these
        conditions:

              i) You must cause any modified files to carry
              prominent notices stating that you changed the files
              and the date of any change.

             ii) You must license the entire work, as a whole,
              under this License to anyone who comes into contact
              with the work.

           A compilation of a covered work with other separate and
        independent works is not a "Derivative Work" for the purposes
        of this License if the compilation is not designed to be
        used as a combined or larger program.

           5. Application of This License to a System Library.

           The System Library, as used in a Derivative Work, may be
        included under this License if you ensure that the use of the
        System Library in the Derivative Work does not conflict with the
        exclusive patent rights that might be granted under this License to the
        System Library.

           If you convey a Derivative Work that contains a System
        Library, you may also convey, and cause others to convey,
        the System Library under this License, provided that you also meet all
        of the following conditions:

              a) The System Library must be included in the Source form
              of the Derivative Work.

              b) The System Library must retain the copyright notice
              and the license notice from the Source form of the
              System Library.

              c) When you convey the Derivative Work, you may
              license the System Library separately from the Derivative Work.

        6. Trademarks.

           This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of
        the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
        customary use in describing the origin of the Program and
        reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

        7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

           UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
        WRITING, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
        WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS
        OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES
        OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
        NONINFRINGEMENT.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT
        HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
        LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
        OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
        PROGRAM OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE PROGRAM.

        8. Limitation of Liability.

           IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE PROGRAM IS USED, THE
        AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
        ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
        USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA
        OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED
        BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO
        OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH AUTHOR OR
        COPYRIGHT HOLDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGES.

        9. Additional Terms.

           You are not required to accept this License, since you have
        not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to
        modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.
        These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
        License.  Therefore, by modifying, copying, distributing, or
        otherwise using the Program, you indicate your acceptance of this
        License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
        copying, distributing or modifying the Program.

        10. No Endorsement.

           You may not use the name of the Licensor or
        contributors to endorse or promote products derived from this
        Program without prior written permission.  For example,
        if the Program includes interactive functionality that
        calls on a separate library, you must not use that
        library's name to promote your product, and may not use
        that library's name in advertising or publicity.

        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

        How to Apply the GPL to Your New Programs

           If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the
        greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free
        software that everyone can redistribute and change under the terms of
        this license.  To do so, attach the following notices to the
        program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each
        source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty;
        and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
        reference to where the full notice is found.

           <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
           Copyright (C) 2025 AirML Contributors

           This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
           it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
           the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
           (at your option) any later version.

           Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

           If the program does interactive commands, make it print a
        short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

             <program>  Copyright (C) 2025 AirML Contributors
                       This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
                       This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
                       under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

           The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
        appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
        program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use
        an "about box".

           You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
           if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
           For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GPL,
           see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

        The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating
        your program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a
        subroutine library, you may consider allowing it to be linked with proprietary
        programs if you can do so while preserving the free status of your
        program.

        If you have questions about the GPL or need help with applying it,
